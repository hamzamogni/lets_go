# Let's Go book reposiotry

I created this repoitory when I was reading the [Let's Go book by Alex Edwards.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43429043-let-s-go)
I created it to follow with the book examples.

This book is about creating a web application using only standard library packages for an http server and database connection,
it also uses html templates to generate a user interface (again, using the standard library packages).

The author's follow-up book (Let's go further), teaches a more _**MoDeRn**_ to create RESTful JSON APIs using standard library packages,
another repository will be created to follow with that book.
